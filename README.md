# Customer Data Profile
ETL Project for Customer Data Profiles

Overview

An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project was implemented to build comprehensive customer data profiles from various source systems into a data warehouse.

Objective

ETL Process

The ETL process extracts data from the source systems, transforms it into a unified format, and loads it into the customer profile tables in the data warehouse.

Key steps:

Perform transformations such as cleansing, standardization, and business logic
Load the data into the customer profile tables using merge queries
Schedule daily and weekly ETL jobs to refresh the customer profiles
Output

Purchase history
Voucher usage
